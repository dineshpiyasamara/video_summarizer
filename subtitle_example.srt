00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,438
Now when I go to unstructured format, we have log files here,

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,710
audio files, videos and images. So these are all considered

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,278
as unstructured files and sorrel. It is

4
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:13,774
also because of the speed of accumulation of all this variety

5
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:16,838
of data altogether, which brings us to our third

6
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:20,290
v which is velocity. So if you look here earlier we were.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,846
Now let's focus on the diagram. So here you can notice that the hard

8
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:28,234
disk capacity is increasing but the disk transfer

9
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:32,154
performance or speed is not. Speed is not a lot of data.

10
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:36,154
And when you talk about people generating data or Internet reshma,

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,826
the one kind of application that strikes first in my mind is social media.

12
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:43,546
So you tell me. You tell me. You tell me. You tell me.

13
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,986
Thank you and have a great day. I hope you

14
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:50,154
